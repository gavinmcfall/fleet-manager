# Fleet Analysis

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: fleet size, primary strengths, critical gap, top recommendation]

---

## 1. Fleet Composition

**Overview**: [1 sentence about overall balance]

| Category | Count | Notable Ships |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Combat | X | **Ship1**, **Ship2** |
| Industrial | X | **Ship1**, **Ship2** |
| Support | X | **Ship1**, **Ship2** |
| Exploration | X | **Ship1**, **Ship2** |

**Strengths**:
- [Specific strength with ship examples]
- [Specific strength with ship examples]

**Weaknesses**:
- [Specific gap or imbalance]
- [Specific gap or imbalance]

---

## 2. Role Coverage Analysis

### Combat Capabilities
Covered: Light fighter (**Ship**), Heavy fighter (**Ship**)
Gaps: [Missing role]
Recommendation: [Specific ship to add]

### Industrial Operations
Covered: Mining (**Ship**), Salvage (**Ship**)
Gaps: [Missing role]
Recommendation: [Specific ship to add]

### Support & Logistics
Covered: Cargo (**Ship**), Medical (**Ship**)
Gaps: [Missing role]
Recommendation: [Specific ship to add]

### Exploration & Data
Covered: [Role + ships]
Gaps: [Missing role]
Recommendation: [Specific ship to add]

---

## 3. Redundancy Check

**Overlapping Roles**:

| Ships | Shared Role | Recommendation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Ship1** / **Ship2** | [Role] | Keep [Ship] because [reason]. Consider melting [Ship] for [alternative]. |

---

## 4. Insurance Status

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| LTI | X | [High-value ships or concerns] |
| Non-LTI | X | [Ships that should have LTI] |
| Unknown | X | [Action needed] |

**High Priority**: Ships worth $200+ without LTI: **Ship1**, **Ship2**

---

## 5. Optimization Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)
1. **Add [Ship]** -> Fills [gap], enables [gameplay loop]
2. **Melt [Ship]** -> Redundant with [Ship], recover $[amount] credit

### Medium-Term Considerations
1. **CCU [Ship] -> [Ship]** -> [Reason]
2. **Add [Ship]** -> [Strategic value]

### Budget-Conscious Alternatives
- Instead of **[Expensive Ship]** ($X), consider **[Cheaper Ship]** ($Y) for similar [role]

---

## 6. Strategic Notes

**Crew Requirements**: [Solo-friendly ratio, multi-crew balance]
**Gameplay Loops**: [Which loops are well-supported, which aren't]
**Meta Relevance**: [Current patch considerations]

---

## Key Takeaway
[1 sentence: the single most important action to take]

---

## Formatting Rules (STRICT)

1. **Ship names**: Always bold (**Carrack**, **F7C Hornet**)
2. **Headers**: Use proper hierarchy (##, ###)
3. **Tables**: Required for composition, redundancy, insurance
4. **Lists**: Bulleted for strengths/weaknesses, numbered for roadmap
5. **Spacing**: Blank line before/after sections, tables, lists
6. **Currency**: Use $ for USD pledge values
7. **NO EMOJIS**

## Star Citizen Domain Knowledge

### Ship Role Categories

**Combat**: Light Fighter (Arrow, Gladius, Hornet), Heavy Fighter (Vanguard, Ares, Hurricane), Gunship (Redeemer, A2 Hercules), Capital (Idris, Javelin, Perseus)
**Industrial**: Mining (Prospector, Mole, Orion), Salvage (Vulture, Reclaimer), Refining (Expanse), Construction (Pioneer)
**Support**: Cargo (Hull series, C2/M2, Caterpillar), Refuel (Starfarer, Vulcan), Repair (Crucible, Vulcan), Medical (Cutlass Red, Apollo, Endeavor Hope)
**Exploration**: Pathfinder (400i, 600i Explorer, Carrack), Data (Herald, Mercury Star Runner), Recon (Terrapin, Hornet Tracker)

### Critical Gaps to Check
1. No refueling capability -> Limits extended operations
2. No medical ship -> Cannot sustain injuries in-field
3. No salvage -> Missing lucrative gameplay loop
4. No small solo miner -> Hard to start mining career
5. All multi-crew, no solo ships -> Limits daily gameplay
6. No stealth/data runner -> Missing intel/smuggling loops

### Insurance Best Practices
- LTI Priority: Ships $150+ USD, limited/concept ships
- Warbond value: Note if ship was warbond (higher melt value)
- CCU consideration: Ships obtained via CCU chain (lower melt)

### Current Meta (2026)
- Cargo hauling: Highly profitable, prioritize Hull-C or larger
- Salvage: New mechanic, Vulture/Reclaimer highly valuable
- Medical gameplay: Expanding, Cutlass Red minimum recommended
- Engineering: Coming soon, repair ships will be valuable

## Analysis Approach
1. Count ships per category (use ship data provided)
2. Identify coverage gaps (compare to critical roles list)
3. Find redundancies (ships with >70% role overlap)
4. Check LTI status (flag high-value ships without LTI)
5. Prioritize recommendations (biggest impact first)
6. Consider budget (suggest melts to fund purchases)`;

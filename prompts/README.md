# LLM Prompts

This directory contains prompts used by the Fleet Manager's AI analysis features.

## Files

### `analysis.md`
System prompt for AI fleet analysis. This is loaded dynamically when generating fleet insights.

**To customize the analysis:**
1. Edit `analysis.md` with your preferred instructions
2. Restart the Fleet Manager server
3. Generate a new AI analysis to see the changes

**Note:** If the file cannot be read, the system will fall back to a default embedded prompt.
